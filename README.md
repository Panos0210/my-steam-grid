# my-steam-grid
this is my steam grid that i use :)

to download press code then download as zip, extract it and go to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\ (random numbers) and paste the config folder, now check on steam if they are there if they are not restart steam

if you are updating the grid it is the exact same process but youll press replace all instead of skipping the already pasted files bc sometimes i change them

note: some games like dbh and rdr2 have alternitive grids that are named "app id""type of badkground (p or h)"_alt
