# my-steam-grid
this is my steam grid that i use use and maintain :)
there are 2 main ways of installing it:
1. (Recommended) just get the [exe](https://github.com/Panos0210/panso-steam-grid/releases/download/2.0/Download.Grid.exe) or [appimage](https://github.com/Panos0210/panso-steam-grid/releases/download/2.0/Download.Grid.Linux.AppImage) installer and run it. thats all. everything else is pretty self explanatory with instructions inside the app
   
2. press the green code button on the top of the screen then download as zip, extract it and go to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\ (random numbers) and paste the config folder, now check on steam if they are there if they are not restart steam

if you are updating the grid it is the exact same process but youll press replace all instead of skipping the already pasted files bc sometimes i change them

note: some games like dbh and rdr2 have alternitive grids that are named "app id""type of background (p or h)"_alt

# Future Plans
i will continue to maintain it (as i actually use it for myself too and thats the reason i made it in the first place) but i dont intend into making a macos version as i dont own a mac and dont have pans to get one. additionally macos and linux are very similar (from what i understand macos is linux based but im not sure) so the appimage may work for that too. but idk

and i dont think that there will be a new version after 2.0 as compiling it into a appimage was really hard and im not looking into redoing the whole process and there isnt anything else to add
